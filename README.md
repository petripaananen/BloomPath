# 🌸 BloomPath: The Garden of Productivity

BloomPath is a **Digital Twin of Organization (DTO)** that visualizes project management data (Jira) as a dynamic 3D "Garden of Productivity" in Unreal Engine 5. It bridges the gap between abstract workflows and spatial awareness.

---

## 1. The Garden of Productivity (Visual Metaphor)
Transforms complex Jira data into intuitive organic growth:
- **Issues as Plants**: Each task manifests as a growing branch or leaf.
- **Organic Metadata Mapping**: 
  - **Priority ➔ Scale**: Urgent tasks appear larger.
  - **Epic ➔ Color**: Visual grouping by project area/epic.
- **Blocker Thorns**: Impediments and blocked issues manifest as thorns, providing a "glance-able" view of bottlenecks.

## 2. The PWM (Project World Model) Pipeline
A state-of-the-art AI-driven automation loop:
- **Intent Parsing**: Extracts design prompts from Jira tickets.
- **Spatial Synthesis**: Generates 3D world segments from requirements (Marble AI).
- **AI Validation (Genie 3)**: Simulates gameplay within the generated world to verify functional requirements.
- **Semantic Tagging (Gemini)**: Vision-based analysis that automatically injects physics and navigation data into the UE5 environment.

## 3. Environmental Intelligence (Sprint Weather)
The atmosphere of the garden reflects the **real-time health** of the sprint:
- **Sprint Weather**:
  - ☀️ **Sunny**: High velocity, on track.
  - ⛈️ **Stormy**: Critical blockers or behind schedule.
- **Sprint Clock**: Time-of-day (Dawn to Sunset) maps to the current sprint cycle progress.

## 4. Future-Proof Planning (The "Dreaming Engine")
Advanced "What-If" simulations that let the system "see" into the project's future:
- **Project Forecasting**: The garden "dreams" potential outcomes, showing how your project will likely grow based on today's trends.
- **Early-Warning Visuals**: Predicts and visualizes upcoming risks (like bottlenecks) as "storm clouds" over specific areas before they hit your Jira board.
- **Stress-Testing**: Test "what-if" scenarios—like adding extra scope or shifting team resources—and see the visual impact on delivery immediately.
- **Smart Decision Support**: Simple summaries of best and worst-case outcomes to help teams stay proactive.

## 5. Bidirectional Interaction
A truly interactive DTO, not just a dashboard:
- **Watering Loop**: Interacting with plants in UE5 (e.g., watering) can trigger status transitions in Jira.
- **Avatar Presence**: Team members are represented as "Gardener NPCs" near their assigned tasks.
- **Spatial Audio**: Success chimes and risk notification sounds provide an immersive auditory feedback layer.
